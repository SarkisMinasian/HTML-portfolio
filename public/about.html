<p>Finally, I have found my passion, and I am studying to become a web developer. When I sit and write code, it helps me relax, and I stop overthinking about many things. I was born and raised in Syria and spent 12 years of my life there. During these years, I have experienced a lot due to the ongoing war that has ravaged the country. The war has been a trial for me and my family, and we have faced challenges and dangers that have deeply affected us. Due to the difficult circumstances and the search for safety and a brighter future, my family and I made the decision to flee from Syria and settle in Sweden. The country has offered us a haven, a place where we can live in peace and hope for a better future..</p>
